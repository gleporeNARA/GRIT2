manual compile of grit project:
the tika jar file will have to be extracted! unzip with your favorite zipping utility
create a directory called \production and unzip all content of tika into this directory
after extracting tika, using command line utility, cd into production\META-INF\ and modify
the MANIFEST.MF file like this:

echo Main-Class: grit.Main>MANIFEST.MF

create a new directory in \production called grit, like this: production\grit

current working directory should contain tika-app-1.13.jar, production directory, and
	the'cloned' NARA-GRIT directory from github

compile with
	javac -cp tika-app-1.13.jar;. -sourcepath NARA-GRIT\src\grit -d production NARA-GRIT\src\grit\*.java


create runnable jar with
	jar cvfm GRIT.jar production\META-INF\MANIFEST.MF -C production/ .

I just discovered a simpler way to produce the output jar file, rather than extracting
and repackaging all the tika files just to include the grit files, we simply update
the tika-app-1.13.jar file with the compiled grit classes and have manifest points to the
grit.Main to run the grit application. the tika-app-1.13.jar can be rename to GRIT.jar
and that will become the grit application.

to do this, create a temporary directory and put the following items in it:
\grit				--> the grit directory with all the compiled java classes, no sub-directories!
MANIFEST.MF			--> the manifest file to points to the grit.Main to run the grit application
tika-app-1.13.jar	--> this is the jar file that we will be updating

now we just put the \grit directory and the manifest into the tika-app-1.13.jar, and rename
tika-app-1.13.jar into GRIT.jar and we have our production application.
cd into current directory with the above items and update the tika jar  like this:
	jar ufm tika-app-1.13.jar MANIFEST.MF grit\* && rename tika-app-1.13 GRIT.jar
	
where u, f and m is flags for update files with manifest
